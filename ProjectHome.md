TIYARAFT is a Grid Service discovery, monitoring and scheduling tool created by the students enrolled in Grid Computing Systems course with Dr. Kent.

TIYARAFT aims to provide researchers with an easy to use tool to discover grid resources using MDS. Tiyaraft aims to provide a GUI to MDS in GT4.0. It includes WSRF implementations of the Index Service, a Trigger Service, WebMDS (also known as the Web Service Data Browser) and the underlying framework, the Aggregator Framework.

Benefits of using TIYARAFT -

1) The system is scalable and it adapts when services are added or removed
2) Status and performance information is made available for use by other system components via a web service interface
3) Test results are returned in XML format and can be accessed and used by other software programs
4) Web-based visualizers format the status information for review by human operators

Requirements -
1) Globus Toolkit GT4.0.8
